*   This program seeks to create a string of all prime numbers that is 1000 integers long, and then allow the user to 
*   display a 5 character "slice" of this string by inputting the n value. It utilizes 2 functions to do this,
*   'string get_concatenated_primes()' and 'string get_slice_of_five'. The first function creates the string, and the 
*   second function displays the 5 integers according to the users input. The provided main function includes the test
*   test cases and takes the user input. This program assumes that the user input is between 0 and 1000, and that the
*   indexing in the string starts from 0.
